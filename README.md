# OCR-CNN

I built this project as part of my Data Science training at DataScientest.

The aim is to transcript texts in several images by using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques.

First model was inspired by Lenet algorithm, the second one (that I will add shortly) uses object detection techniques.
